# Face-recognition-ML
#Objective:
Assess the candidateâ€™s ability to develop and integrate face detection and recognition models.

Test Case Description:

1. Dataset Provision:
- Use a dataset of images with labeled faces.

2. Implementation Tasks:
Face Detection:
- Implement a face detection model
Face Recognition:
- Build a face recognition model

3. Model Functionality:
- Detect faces in an image.
- Extract features from the detected faces.
- Match the detected faces to the known labeled faces in the dataset.
