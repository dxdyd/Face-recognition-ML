# Face-recognition-ML
# Objective:

Assess the candidateâ€™s ability to develop and integrate face detection and recognition models.

# Test Case Description:
# Dataset Provision:

Use a dataset of images with labeled faces.
Implementation Tasks:

# Face Detection:
Implement a face detection model.
Face Recognition:
Build a face recognition model.
Model Functionality:

Detect faces in an image.
Extract features from the detected faces.
Match the detected faces to the known labeled faces in the dataset.
Libraries Used:
face_recognition:

The face_recognition library simplifies the process of face detection and recognition using the dlib library's pre-trained models. It provides easy-to-use functions for detecting faces, encoding faces, and comparing them. This library is built on top of dlib and leverages its powerful deep learning models for face recognition.
# cv2_imshow:

Part of the OpenCV library, cv2_imshow is used for displaying images in a Jupyter notebook or IPython environment. It helps visualize the results of face detection and recognition in an interactive manner.

# os:

The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system. It is used to navigate the file system, read and write files, and handle file paths.

# dlib:

dlib is a powerful C++ library with Python bindings for implementing machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It includes efficient implementations of algorithms for image processing, object detection, and face recognition. It is widely used for building real-time applications due to its speed and accuracy.

# cv2:

OpenCV (cv2) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library. It provides a wide range of tools for image and video processing. In the context of face detection and recognition, OpenCV can be used for pre-processing images, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces, and handling image files.

# numpy:

numpy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. In face recognition tasks, numpy is often used for handling image data and performing numerical operations on face encodings.
